However, in many scenarios, it requires unnecessary, repetitive manual work from IT Administrators hindering the flow of collaboration from the project team which can slow down productivity. Moreover, there is no place in Microsoft 365 OOTB to find all workspaces and search groups and sites based on enterprise metadata, different template types, and display name. Valo Teamwork is the solution with automated governance including naming policies, default membership, security features, and much more.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/div\u003E"
