              "\u003Cdiv\u003EFor an organization to successfully innovate, the ideation process needs to be democratized. Ideas need to come from every level in the organization, e.g. from Firstline Workers to the senior management. Lack of proper tools and processes for making the voice of the employees heard is always a challenge in the innovation process. Coupled with the recent pandemic and the need to work from home, employees feel a disconnect from the organization. They might feel that their ideas are not being listened to and as a result the organization might suffer.\u003Cbr style=\u0022box-sizing:border-box;font-family:SegoeUI;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-size:16px;text-align:left;\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cbr style=\u0022box-sizing:border-box;font-family:SegoeUI;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-size:16px;text-align:left;\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAt the same time, the suggestions made by the users need to reach the right decision makers in an organized way. If the decision makers are not able to get an overview of the ideas, process them, and green-light the successful ideas, then the innovation process could be hampered.\u003Cbr style=\u0022box-sizing:border-box;font-family:SegoeUI;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-size:16px;text-align:left;\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cbr style=\u0022box-sizing:border-box;font-family:SegoeUI;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-size:16px;text-align:left;\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFinally, to empower the employees, they need to be kept in the loop about the status of their idea.

              "\u003Cdiv\u003EValo Ideas app brings the innovation and ideation process right into Microsoft Teams. We believe that since users are already working day-to-day in Microsoft Teams, they should have minimum friction to suggest an idea. Due to Valo Ideas being fully available on the Microsoft Teams mobile app, users are able to submit their ideas on the go as well. This is particularly helpful to Firstline Workers who always work onsite.\u003Cbr style=\u0022box-sizing:border-box;font-family:SegoeUI;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-size:16px;text-align:left;\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cbr style=\u0022box-sizing:border-box;font-family:SegoeUI;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-size:16px;text-align:left;\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESince Valo Ideas is natively built into the Microsoft Teams platform, we are seamlessly able to integrate into the Microsoft Teams user interface.
