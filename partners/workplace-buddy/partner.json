That\u0027s why we start with an interview, to get to know you better. This gives us the insights to automatically create a relevant, personal learning journey. The interview also returns general company insights, so you can find out the exact digital skill gap in your company and take appropriate action.\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E \u003C/div\u003E",

As we continuously monitor (anonimously) conversations and e-learnings and thereby the trends in interests of users, we build relevant content. Our content motivates, inspires and is fun. We deliver this content in campaigns, where the chatbot will proactively reach out to persons who need this content.\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E \u003C/div\u003E",

If wou want to make impact with your organization, you have to enable your colleagues to become digital winners. Of course, each organization is different and that\u0027s why we\u0027ve build an administrator side where you can monitor, add your own specific content (be it chatbot conversations or e-learnings) and create your own badges (motivating colleagues to go for your organization\u0027s goals).\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E \u003C/div\u003E"
