The topic wouldn\u0027t always warrant a new channel, as it could simply be a classroom topic set by a teacher. The posts tab within Microsoft Teams isn\u0027t contextual enough for this need, and the thread of the conversation can be lost and difficult to find as days go by and new posts are created.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/div\u003E"
